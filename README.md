# timeliner
PoC to have an automatic timeliner from hdd files

Support just DOS/MBR magic type.
That will be updating to take all supported files by log2timeline

You juste have to create 3 directories and update this constants :

IN
OUT
END

IN -> Put your own dd file
OUT -> you will have your plaso files and csv files
END -> Moving the file at the end of the thread.
